        <h3>'Lil bit about me</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Elliott (as you can probably tell). I enjoy programming, robotics, hockey and debate/other forms of public speaking!</p>
        <p>I currently abide in NYC (yk that place where like 8 million people crowd into a train every day) and uhh yeah.</p>
        <p>I competed in <stance style="color: rgb(138, 92, 238)";> NHRL </stance> with a really uhh interesting bot design in 2023, not gonna link it cuz embarrasing (it was called echo bot btw), but I've been improving and I'm gonna get back in the combat robotics scene soon(ish)!</p>
